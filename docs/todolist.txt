0.7 - GPU & Rendering?
- VK renderer: cut-out sky areas by extending walls infinitely and marking with alpha '0'.
    - Draw sky sprite in areas marked as alpha '0'
- VK renderer: rework automap for high precision
- Vk renderer: get screen fades working
- Vk renderer: get loading plaque draw working
- Vk renderer: implement proper scaling and widescreen support
- Vk renderer: add option for 32-bit (smooth) shading
- Vk renderer: device selection: add code to ensure all formats used are supported
- Classic renderer: allow wall heights > 256 units; make adjustments to the renderer to split up overly tall wall columns.
- Maybe get rid of use of the 'scratchpad' and use globals or locals (where possible) for LIBGPU primitives.
- Investigate view bobbing run vs walk.
- Add a level end timer for speedrunning?
- Add fast-load (skip waiting for sound to stop playing) for speedrunning?
- Investigate occasional glitches switching between classic and new vk renderer
    - First noticed in House Of Pain, in lava area near the entrace.
    - More noticeable when moving.
- Fix occasional stiching on firesky texture with new VK renderer.
- Investigate game end pause issue (unable to unpause)
    - May need to prioritize continue vs pause if conflicting key bindings
- Fix bug when pausing and turning with view snapping back slightly.
- Investigate default key bindings - Q & E for example.
    - Maybe remove a few, might be be more confusing to have too many bindings.
- Investigate Final Doom music pitch issue mentioned on Doomworld.
- Investigate TCache overflow mentioned on Doomworld.
- Investigate enemy sounds not playing sometimes. Deeper issue with WESS api or attenuation bug?
- Use interpolation for map view.

0.8 - Limit extending and modding?
- Investigate a MAPINFO format for naming maps, choosing music etc.
- Investigate engine limits and try to remove/expand where possible
    - No texture cache overflow
    - Expanded VRAM
    - Expanded SRAM
    - More audio voices.
    - Greatly enlargened heap
    - Remove temporary buffer limits
    - Remove geometry clipping limits where possible
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via map wads.
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via custom user wads.

0.9 - Networking, saves and interpolation?
- Investigate rollback networking to combat latency.
    - Could also be used for a rewind feature??!
    - Could also be used for a save feature.
- Interpolate player weapon sway
- Investigate interpolation for sprites and sectors in addition to player view.

1.0 - Final polish?
- Linux support.
- Implement playing the intro movies and legal text
- Add demo recording support and a new demo format that supports 30 FPS recording and analog movement.
    - Still support old format for playback, add signature to demo start to identify.
- Do a final review/diff against PSXDOOM-RE to double check for any inconsistencies.
- Writeup final readmes and docs.
- Makeup final logo
