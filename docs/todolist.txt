0.6 - Sound, timing & QOL improvements?
- Do an error message on failure to connect in multiplayer games explaining the issue.

0.7 - GPU & Rendering?
- Try to fix Avocado occasional flickering/twitching pixels with rasterizer.
    - Need to run at capped framerate to see properly.
- Make GPU primitives go more directly to the rasterizer rather than through a buffer.
- Break the link between the GPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Investigate a possible 'high res' or crispy mode.
    - May need an extended framebuffer for this
    - May be more feasible in a completely rewritten renderer
- Investigate the possibility of dithering to improve rendering output.
- Allow wall heights > 256 units; make adjustments to the renderer to split up overly tall wall columns.
- Fix bug in cmd queue stuff - occasional geometry weirdness.
    - Not triggered in practice? Might be just a theoretical bug.
- Investigate rendering glitch when above a sprite sometimes (appears enlargened on screen)
    - May need tools to help with this
- Automap: fix lines being clipped 1 pixel short
- Maybe get rid of use of the 'scratchpad' and use globals or locals (where possible) for LIBGPU primitives.

0.8 - Limit extending and modding?
- Investigate a MAPINFO format for naming maps, choosing music etc.
- Investigate engine limits and try to remove/expand where possible
    - No texture cache overflow
    - Expanded VRAM
    - Expanded SRAM
    - Greatly enlargened heap
    - Remove temporary buffer limits
    - Remove geometry clipping limits where possible
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via map wads.
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via custom user wads.

0.9 - Networking, saves and interpolation?
- Investigate rollback networking to combat latency.
    - Could also be used for a rewind feature??!
    - Could also be used for a save feature.
- Investigate interpolation for sprites and sectors in addition to player view.

1.0 - Final polish?
- Linux support.
- Implement playing the intro movies and legal text
- Add demo recording support and a new demo format that supports 30 FPS recording and analog movement.
    - Still support old format for playback, add signature to demo start to identify.
- Do a final review/diff against PSXDOOM-RE to double check for any inconsistencies.
- Writeup final readmes and docs.
- Makeup final logo
